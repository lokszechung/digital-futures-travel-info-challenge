Their latest idea is a web-based travel information application. The initial requirement is to display a 5 day weather forecast for any searchable location with the functionality to be able to save favourite locations locally.

- The user should see a location search box when they access the application home page that allows them to search any town or city by name (as per the wireframe supplied)

- The application should be responsive across the main breakpoints for devices (mobile, tablet, desktop) - wireframes are provided for each of these
