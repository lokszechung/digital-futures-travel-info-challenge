# Further Developments for the Weather/Travel App

Potential further development possibilities:

### Add the ability for users to login to an account on the website.

Implementation:

- This could be implemented by creating a backend service that stores a user's details and includes an authentication system to secure access to the user's profile and information.

Benefits:

- The user's preferences and saved locations can be accessed from any device on which they are logged in, instead of items being saved in local storage which is specific to each device. This may incentive them to use the app more often, increasing time spent on the business' website.
- The business can keep track of the user's data (such as saved locations and other preferences) and use that for market research or to personalise adverts and target marketing towards the individual. The data can also be used to tailor app experience to different users.

Risks:

- If there are any security breaches, such as leaked sensitive personal information, it would damage the business' reputation.
- Data Privacy laws would have to be carefully adhered to, which could lead to increase in costs such as legal liabilities or loss of efficiency.

### Develop the app into a booking site

Implementation:

- This could be implemented by adding a booking feature that allows users to book accommodations, flights and other travel-realated services directly through the app.

Benefits:

- Being able to make bookings from one platform would enhance the user experience, increasing user engagement and rentention.
- The business could use the opportunity to take commission from each booking made through the website, increasing the revenue and profitability of the app.

Risks:

- Any problems which may arise, such as unfulfilled bookings, despite being out of the business' control, could reflect poorly on the business, harming its reputation.
- Online booking platforms is a market with strong players, such as Booking.com, Airbnb and Expedia, which could make it difficult market ro penetrate. Failure to break into the market could mean the business makes losses from the R&D, time and resources put into the project.

### Develop the app into a transport app

Implementation:

- This could be implemented by integrating a third-party transportation API to the app, which provides the user with schedules, routes, prices and fares etc.

Benefits:

- Being able to check how to get from city to city and showing cheapest or fastest routes would enhance the user experience, increasing user engagement and rentention.
- The app would be a one-stop shop for travel planning, filling a gap in the market. Early market penetration allows the business to capture a significant share of the market before competitors emerge, solidifying its position and brand recognition among users.

Risks:

- Providing accurate travel information is crucial for users, as even small delays can impact a user's journey drastically. Unreliable travel information can quickly dissaude users from using the app.
- Competition from established transport apps, such as CityMapper still exists, although the business' app may be more feature-rich when travelling between cities and countries.
